Linux Scripts – Hands-on Practice

This repository is a collection of Bash scripts created as part of my practical training with Linux (Red Hat).  
Each script demonstrates core system administration tasks and basic shell scripting concepts.  

The goal of this repo is to apply what I’ve learned and practice real-world 
 
I hope you like it.
